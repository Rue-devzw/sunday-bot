        "God, our heavenly Father, has made a very special and wonderful place for the angels and for us. It is called Heaven, and it is way up above us in the sky. We can't see Heaven, but we know it's there because God said it is.",
        "The Bible tells us that Heaven is made up of all kinds of beautiful things. It is a very big place, and it has a beautiful city in it. The city is long and high and wide. God made sure there will be room enough for everyone. He made it so beautiful because He loves us and wants us to be happy there. Inside the city, He built many big houses called mansions where those who love Jesus will live.",
        "Around the city, there is a wall with twelve gates. God used many different colors of stones to make foundations for the wall. Some of the stones are like sparkling jewels, but they are much bigger than any we have ever seen. The gates are made of pearls. The streets are of gold so pure they look like clear glass. Can you imagine how shiny and pretty they must be?",
        "Heaven is a wonderful place in which to live, and everyone there is always happy. God and Jesus are there with many of our friends and people we love. Because Jesus is there, it never gets dark. He is the Light of Heaven.",
        "There is nothing in Heaven to make us sad. No one ever cries there because God has wiped away all our tears. No mean people live there because all the people have had their hearts washed clean. There is no sin in Heaven. No one ever gets sick or dies in Heaven. God never lets any of these things happen there. Heaven is a happy, happy place.",
        "In Heaven there will be lots of children to play with, and grown-ups too. You will already know some of the people, and the rest of them will be new friends. You will like everyone there. The people will come from many different places around the world, and all of them love God. Everyone will be happy in Heaven where they can be with Him. God loves us so much He wants us to live there with Him forever! That is why He made Heaven.",
        "Up in Heaven, God has a book called the Lamb's Book of Life. We can get our names in God's special Book by telling Him we love Him and that we are sorry for the naughty things we have done. Then He makes our hearts clean and writes our names in His Book. If our names are there, we will go to Heaven someday. Remember, He has a special place waiting just for you!"

        "There was once a serpent who could talk! He was a very pretty serpent, but he was bad and sneaky. In fact, Satan himself was in the serpent. The serpent lived in the Garden of Eden. That was a special and beautiful place God had made for the first two people He created, Adam and Eve.",
        "Adam and Eve loved God, but the serpent did not. He hated God and wanted Adam and Eve to hate God too. So the serpent thought up a wicked plan. He would trick Adam and Eve into doing something God had said not to do.",
        "One day the serpent saw Eve in the Garden and spoke to her. He knew God had told Adam and Eve not to eat the fruit from a certain tree that grew right in the middle of the Garden. But he asked her anyway, \"Did God really say you couldn't eat from all the trees in the Garden?\"",
        "Eve answered that they could eat from all the trees except one. That was a special tree called the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil. Then the serpent lied to Eve. He said if she ate the fruit from that tree, she would be very smart, just like God.",
        "Instead of telling the serpent to go away, Eve went over and looked at the fruit on that special tree. How pretty it was! How tasty it looked! Then she did exactly what God had told her not to do. She reached out and picked one fruit. She took a bite. Then she went to Adam and gave some to him. He took a bite too.",
        "Adam and Eve knew God had said not to eat the fruit from that tree, but they didn't obey God. God calls that sin. Whenever we do something we know we should not do, it is a sin.",
        "The serpent was very pleased when he saw that his wicked plan had worked. Adam and Eve had sinned. God was very unhappy because Adam and Eve had not obeyed Him. But He was mostly unhappy at the serpent for tricking Eve.",
        "God loved Adam and Eve but, because they had sinned, they had to be punished. God sent them away from the Garden of Eden. They could never go in there again. To keep them out, God had an angel with a flaming sword watch over the Garden.",

One day he had gone to hear Jesus teach, and had sat right near Jesus' feet. What wonderful words Jesus had spoken! From that day on, Micah realized that Jesus was the promised Messiah, the Son of God. Just a few days before, Micah had watched Jesus ride into Jerusalem on a little donkey. How happy everyone had been that day! So, why would the soldiers have taken Him now?",
        "\"The rulers of our country said Jesus has to die,\" Ezra panted, out of breath. \"They got some people to tell lies about Him. The soldiers are going to crucify Him on that hill outside the city.\"",
        "Micah could hardly believe he was hearing right. Crucify Jesus? That meant the soldiers were going to nail Jesus to a cross! Jesus had done nothing wrong! Micah knew that. \"It must be a mistake,\" he said to Ezra. \"Maybe it was someone else, some bad person.\"",
        "\"Yes, it was Jesus,\" Ezra said, the tears trickling down his dusty cheeks. \"I saw Him myself.\"",
        "\"Oh, no!\" Micah began to cry too. \"Jesus never did anything bad! He is a good man!\"",
        "What sadness filled the hearts of the two boys. Could they do anything to help Jesus? They must find out. But by the time they made their way through the crowds of people, the soldiers already had nailed Jesus to the cross. Two thieves were also being crucified, one on each side of Jesus.",

God called the dry land earth, and it had just the shape God wanted. The tall mountains reached up to the sky, with deep valleys nestled in between. God put green grass on the land. He put trees, flowers, and bushes here and there.",

The wide, sweeping rivers flowed into the seas. God looked around at the land and the waters He had arranged, and He knew it was beautiful. He was happy with what He had created.",

Crabs and turtles crawled along the golden sand at the edges of the ocean waves.",

Some of the birds were big, with strong wings that could carry them long distances. Little tiny hummingbirds, no bigger than your thumb, moved from flower to flower. Peacocks strutted about, showing their beautiful tail feathers. The noisy woodpeckers began tapping away with their long beaks. God created all this on the fifth day, and He saw that it was good.",

That is what is important to Him.",

Maybe they even brought bags of money and poured it into the money box there. Jesus was watching them and He knew just how much they gave. He also knew that they still had a lot of money left for themselves.",

Jesus told His disciples that the poor woman had given the most—far more than any of the others. Do you know why? It was because she had given all she had.",

The mixture looked pretty thin till I put in the flour. Then, rather than get out the measuring spoons, I just poured some salt and baking powder into my hand, the way I'd seen Mom do. I stirred them into the dough. Last of all, I put in the whole bag of chips, except the ones I had already eaten.",
        "I put globs of dough all over the cookie sheet. Mom had already turned the oven on for me, so in a little while the cookies were done. They didn't smell too bad, but they sure didn't look like the ones Mom makes. And when I took a bite—yuck! They tasted awful!",
        "Mom came in about then, so I gave her one. When she took a bite, she got a funny look on her face. She asked me what I had changed in the recipe. I was afraid she might be upset with me, but I told her why I hadn't used it.",
        "She just looked at me and shook her head. Then she took the recipe and showed me the right way to make cookies. It took a little longer, but they tasted so much better. I was very thankful that Mom showed me the right way.",
        "There's a lesson in what happened to me. Shall I tell you what it is? Well, just like the recipe told me the right way to make cookies, God gave us a Book that tells us the right way to live. That Book is the Bible. He wants us to do what the Book says. He doesn't want us to make a “mess” out of our lives like I made out of the cookies when I tried to make them my own way. God is so happy when we take time to read His Book.",

        "Mary could hardly believe her eyes! She had thought she was alone as she worked. Then suddenly, there was an angel standing before her! He greeted her and began his message. He told Mary God was with her, and she was the most blessed of all women.",
        "Mary did not understand what this meant. She knew God was always with her, but this sounded different. Was He to be even closer? And to call her blessed! What could this mean? She was still a young lady, and she was afraid.",
        "The angel told her not to be afraid. He said God was very pleased with her. But the next words he spoke seemed to echo around her. \"Thou shalt . . . bring forth a son . . . He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest. . . .\"",
        "Mary knew that this really was an angel sent by God. The message he had brought was amazing, but since it was from God it had to be true. Still, she wondered . . . how could this thing be? How could it possibly be?",
        "The angel had said that her baby would be the Son of God! She loved God, but her family was just ordinary. They had no special place of honor in the city. Surely, if God was going to send His Son to earth, He would want Him to be born into a royal family. Surely, God would choose a queen to be the mother of His Son. Mary had never had a child before. How could she be trusted to raise God's own Son?",
        "As the angel spoke to her and explained what was to happen, Mary's fear began to go away. If this was what God wanted, she was willing to do her part. God would give her the strength and wisdom she needed.",
        "As she thought about the angel's message, her wonder and amazement grew. A baby boy! She was going to have a tiny baby boy to hold and love and care for. Her son would be God's Son, Jesus. Then she said, from the bottom of her heart, \"I belong to You, God. Whatever You say, I will do.\"",
        "Soon after that, the angel of the Lord visited Joseph in a dream. He told him that God was going to give Mary a special baby, God's Son. Joseph was to be the baby's earthly father. They were to name the baby Jesus, because He would save His people from their sins.",
        "When Joseph awoke he knew that his dream had been true. He did as the angel had told him to do. Mary and he were soon married. When the baby was born, Joseph called Him Jesus, just as the angel had said he should."

But the innkeeper here says we may use the stable in the back.\" He gathered up the reins of the donkey.",

But it had to be done. It was an order!",

        "The little family was tired from the excitement of the day. They settled down for a good night's rest.",
        "Joseph awoke suddenly. He rubbed his eyes. Just moments ago an angel had visited Joseph in a dream. The message he gave was urgent. Joseph thought, There is no time to lose! Quickly he lit the oil lamp and shook Mary from her sleep.",
        "\"Mary!\" he whispered. \"An angel came with a message from God. We must leave this city of Bethlehem right away. King Herod is going to try to kill our little Jesus.\"",
        "Startled, Mary sat up. Her eyes were filled with fear. \"Joseph, what can we do? Where can we go?\"",
        "\"The angel said we must go to Egypt,\" Joseph replied. \"We are to stay there until the angel brings us word that it is safe to return.\"",
        "Mary quickly folded the covers from the bed and began gathering their few belongings. Joseph helped her to wrap carefully the gifts that they had received from the Wise Men. He thought of God's wonderful care. God knew they would need money for the journey and their stay in Egypt. How wonderfully He had provided—even ahead of time!",
        "Walking to the open doorway, he looked out into the still night. Everything was quiet in the streets. No one would see them leave. Joseph did not know what would happen to them on this journey, but he was not afraid. God had always been very near to them.",
        "Mary came to Joseph's side with the sleeping child in her arms. They were ready to go. Together they walked to the donkey, and Mary once again settled herself on its back. She thought about the journey from Nazareth before Jesus was born.",
        "Joseph gently laid Jesus into Mary's arms. Like the star guiding the Wise Men, God led the little family until, at last, they reached Egypt.",
        "After they had lived in Egypt for a while, the angel visited them again. This time it was with the good news that it was safe for them to return to Israel. The wicked King Herod had died.",
        "When they reached the land of Israel they went to live in the city of Nazareth. How happy they were to be home once again!"

There was something special about this Man. When He asked John to baptize Him, John said, \"Oh, I couldn't do that! Jesus, You are greater than I am. I need to be baptized by You. Why are You asking me to baptize You?\"",

      "story": [
        "Peter and his brother, Andrew, were getting ready to toss their net into the sea once more. It would be the last net of fish they caught that day. Then they would have to row to shore, put the boat away, and clean the fish. Looking at the net lying at his feet, Peter noticed a hole that had been torn open. He lifted the net and frowned. Well, there's another hole to mend, he thought.",
        "He looked over at Andrew. \"Fishing isn't exciting anymore.\" Right away Andrew knew what he meant. \"It's because of Jesus,\" he replied. He looked up at his brother. \"I've felt the same way. There is something that happens to me when I'm near Him. It makes me want to forget about the fishing business. It just isn't important now.\"",
        "With a sigh, Andrew turned back to the net. He told Peter to help him, and together they tossed it into the water. The boat was rocking gently on the waves when suddenly they heard someone calling their names. Peter turned to Andrew with a puzzled look. Who would be calling to them?",
        "Then he looked toward the shore. \"There's Jesus!\" shouted Peter. \"He is calling us! Come on, Andrew, let's go and see what He wants.\" They turned the boat around and went toward the shore. Even before the boat scraped bottom, Peter jumped out and ran to where Jesus stood. Andrew was close behind him.",
        "When they got to where Jesus was, He told them, \"Follow me and I will make you fishers of men.\" That meant they would not be catching fish anymore. There was a greater job for them to do. He wanted them to be His disciples now. They would be telling other people about God's love. It would be like fishing for people!",
        "That day Peter and Andrew left their boat and nets and became Jesus' disciples. As they walked with Jesus by the seashore, they came to a boat that belonged to a man named Zebedee. He and his two sons, James and John, were sitting in their boat mending their fishing nets.",
        "Jesus called to the two sons and told them to follow Him also. James and John left their boat right away. They knew they wanted to be followers of Jesus. They were happy that Jesus had chosen them to be His helpers.",
        "Jesus chose these four men and also eight others to be His special helpers. They are called the Apostles. Did you know that Jesus wants you to be His helper too? He loves you and has a special plan for you. Wouldn't you like to be a fisher of men and tell others about Jesus?"

        "A good shepherd counts his sheep carefully to make sure all of them are staying right with him. One, two, three . . . Yes, they are all there! He knows that if one of the sheep wanders away it will be frightened. He doesn't want his sheep ever to be afraid.",
        "When it is time for his sheep to eat, a good shepherd looks all around to find the best eating places where the grass is green and tall. He leads them by the cool streams where they can take a good, long drink of fresh water. He knows that sheep get thirsty too.",
        "If his sheep get scratched on some thorns, a good shepherd takes care of all the sore places. He feels so sorry when one of his sheep gets hurt, and he always knows just how to make it feel better.",
        "Sheep sometimes get tired, and then they need to lie down and take a rest. A good shepherd knows that, so he finds a safe place for them to sleep. A good shepherd loves to watch his sheep. He laughs when the little lambs jump and play in the wildflowers. He knows the name of each one. He speaks to them gently, and all of his sheep know his voice. They come when he calls, because they love their good shepherd.",
        "Sometimes there may be danger near, but the sheep are not afraid because their good shepherd is always watching. He makes sure that no big, hungry animal comes near his sheep. They are always safe when they are in the shepherd's care.",
        "Did you know that we are like sheep? And we have a good Shepherd too—the very best Shepherd of all. The Bible tells us that our good Shepherd is Jesus. He takes care of us just the way a good shepherd takes care of his sheep.",
        "Jesus watches over us day and night. He doesn't want us to be afraid of anything, so He stays close beside us. He makes sure that we have food to eat and everything else that we need. He promises to be with us always and keep us from danger.",
        "Why does Jesus do all these things for us? For the same reason that a good shepherd watches over his sheep. He does it because He wants us to be safe and happy. Remember that sheep know and love their good shepherd. Do you know Jesus? Do you love Him? He loves you."

As she looked at that picture she began to think about how different the children were from each other.",

        "Next to Jan was John. Two years ago John had prayed and asked Jesus to come into his heart and make him a Christian. He had loved Sunday school so much and never missed. But last year he had begun to miss Sunday school once in a while. He wasn't learning his memory verses like he used to. And just a few weeks ago John quit coming. Carol had gone to his home to visit him and to see if there was anything wrong. But John told her he wasn't saved any more and didn't want to go to Sunday school. It had made Carol so sad to hear that.",
        "Then, there was Benji. He came to Sunday school only now and then. He always had some reason why he was too busy. Fishing, watching television, or playing ball were all a lot more important to him than learning about Jesus. He told Carol he had only come to Sunday school the day of the picture-taking because he liked to have his picture taken. He seemed to think more of himself than of anything else.",

        "Soon they arrived at the church where everyone was to meet. They would all ride to the mountain together on the big bus. Susie looked all around for Amy. She wanted to be sure they could sit together on the bus. But Amy wasn't there yet! Susie found Brother Bob, who was to have picked up Amy.",
        "\"Where's Amy?\" she asked. \"Well,\" he answered, \"Amy's mom said she wasn't ready yet. She told us not to hold up the whole van load of kids to wait for Amy. Her mom said she would bring Amy here to the church if she got ready in time.\" He looked at his watch. \"But she has only four more minutes. The bus will leave at 8:00 sharp.\"",
        "Susie asked Brother Bob if he wouldn't please wait for just a few extra minutes. She was sure Amy would be there soon. \"Amy and I have been talking about this ski trip for so long. She really wants to go this year,\" said Susie. \"Please wait just five more minutes.\"",
        "Brother Bob did have the bus driver wait for a little bit. But the other kids were anxious to go so the driver finally started the bus and drove away.",
        "A few minutes later Amy's mom drove her into the parking lot of the church. \"Did I make it?\" asked Amy. \"Where's the bus? Where are all the other kids?\" But Amy knew that she hadn't been on time.",
        "Amy had known about this ski trip for a long time. She knew that Susie had started getting ready days before. Amy cried and cried. She thought, Why didn't I start getting ready while there was still time?",
        "You would feel as unhappy as Amy did if you missed an important trip because you weren't ready, wouldn't you? But do you know the most important trip that you must get ready for? It is the trip to Heaven. You must love Jesus more than anything else and do what He wants you to do. Then you will be ready to meet Him. Be sure you are ready in time!"

        "Philip said there were too many people to feed. But Jesus was not worried because He already knew what He would do.",
        "Zach looked down at the small, brown bag in his hand. His mother had filled it for him that morning. She had packed just enough lunch for him. But all around him were people with no food. Suddenly Zach knew what he must do.",
        "He spoke to the disciple, Andrew. \"Please . . . I heard what Jesus said about there being no food for the people. I have a lunch. It's not very much, but I hope Jesus can use it.\" The disciple looked down at the small bag in surprise. He thanked Zach and turned to Jesus.",
        "Zach watched him, wondering if Jesus would like the two fish and five small loaves in his lunch? He listened as Andrew told Jesus that a young boy had offered to give his lunch to Him. A gentle smile came to Jesus' face.",
        "\"Have the people sit down,\" He told His disciples. Zach sat down too, as close to Jesus as he could get. What was going to happen?",
        "Jesus took the bread and fish, looked up to Heaven, and gave thanks for the food. Then He broke the small loaves of bread apart. \"Give this to the people,\" He said, and held out some fish also. The disciples took what Jesus handed them and gave it to the people. Soon all the people were eating.",
        "Zach ate as much bread and fish as he could hold, but he could hardly believe what he was seeing. The disciples kept passing out food. Where did it come from? It never ran out! Soon everyone on the hillside was full. Even the little children who had been so hungry, shook their heads when the disciples offered them more bread or a fish.",
        "Jesus told His disciples to pick up all the food that the people had not eaten. They gathered up twelve baskets of leftovers! Zach had brought just a small bag of fish and bread with him. Now there was more left over than he could ever carry home. Jesus had worked a miracle with the loaves and fishes. How glad Zach was that he had shared!"

        "This morning she and Salome and the other Mary had come bringing sweet-smelling spices to put on the body of Jesus. There had been no time to do this on the day that He had died. As they walked toward the tomb, Mary suddenly remembered that soldiers had placed a huge stone in front of the tomb. How would they be able to move it? The stone was so big that even the three of them together would not be strong enough. Perhaps there would be some men around who would help them.",
        "They were near the tomb when Mary stopped in surprise. \"Look, Mary, Salome! The stone has already been rolled away,\" she said in amazement. It was true. The big stone had been moved over to one side and the tomb was open. Who had done this? Quickly the three women hurried to the entrance and looked inside.",
        "They saw in a moment that the body of Jesus was no longer there. Instead, a young man in a white robe was sitting where Jesus' body had been laid. It was an angel! Mary and her two friends backed away from him in fear.",
        "But the angel spoke in a gentle voice. \"Don't be afraid,\" he told them. \"You are looking for Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified.\" Then he went on to tell them the most startling news. \"He is not here, He is risen!\"",
        "The three women looked at each other in amazement. Risen? That meant that Jesus was no longer dead. Could such a wonderful thing really be true?",
        "The angel went on with his message. \"Go now and tell His disciples and Peter that He is alive and they will see Him in Galilee.\" Mary and the other women quickly obeyed the angel. Their hearts pounded as they hurried away from the tomb.",
        "The announcement the angel made that morning to Mary and her two friends was true. Jesus had risen, just as He had said He would. On that very day He showed Himself to His close friends and helpers. What a special and wonderful day that was for them! But it was a special day for us too. Because Jesus died and rose again, we can live with Him in Heaven someday."

At the end of the ten days we will see who is stronger and wiser—you and your friends or the others.\"",

Daniel knew God was pleased with them because they were doing what they knew was right. Even an order from the king could not make them do something that would make God unhappy.",

And at every meal, Daniel, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego ate their simple food. Perhaps some of the other students were watching these four young men and wondering if they would pass the test. Were they starting to look thin and pale and hungry? What if they got sick because they weren't eating enough? That didn't worry Daniel and his friends at all. They were trusting God and doing their best to obey Him. They knew that He would not fail them.",

God had helped Daniel and his friends to be more healthy than all the other students. But would they be as wise? The man in charge of the students brought them in. The king talked to all of them and asked them many difficult questions. He listened carefully to their answers.",

When Daniel heard the decree, he went to see King Nebuchadnezzar and said, \"O King, why must all the wise men in your kingdom be punished? I serve the true and living God who holds the secrets of all things in His hands. He is able to give the meanings even to forgotten dreams. Only give me time, and God will show me what your dream was and its meaning.\"",

        "Daniel watched the soldier post the law for all to read. Then he walked away thoughtfully. His faithful servant ran up behind him. He grabbed Daniel's arm and whispered, \"O my master, what will you do? You always pray three times a day. But the new law now forbids it.\" Tears streaked down the old servant's cheeks. \"You must stop praying for thirty days. Surely your God will understand.\"",
        "\"I cannot stop praying,\" Daniel replied. \"The God I love and serve means more to me than any law written by man. I will do as I have always done. God is able to protect me.\"",
        "Daniel went to his room and opened his window. Looking out toward the city of Jerusalem, he began to pray. He did this every morning, every noon, and every evening.",
        "There were some men in the kingdom who didn't like Daniel. They were jealous because he was an important helper to the king. And these enemies were watching to see if Daniel would pray. They knew that he prayed at that window every day. They were the ones who had asked the king to write that new law. It was the only way they could catch Daniel doing something against the king's rules.",
        "As soon as they saw that Daniel had broken the king's law, they hurried to the king. They told him, \"Daniel has broken your law. We saw him praying to his God. He must be punished.\"",
        "The king felt terrible. He loved Daniel and didn't want to hurt him. But the law could not be changed. He had to have Daniel punished exactly as the law said. So the king's guards threw Daniel into the lions' den, for that was the punishment the king had ordered.",
        "All the lions looked at Daniel. They walked around him. But none of the lions tried to eat Daniel! God had performed a miracle! God's angel had shut the lions' mouths! Praises flowed from Daniel's heart. \"O God, You have saved me once again. How I thank You!\"",
        "In the morning, the king got up very early and hurried to the lions' den. \"Daniel,\" he called, his voice trembling, \"was your God able to deliver you?\" How happy he was when he heard Daniel's voice coming from the den. \"O King, live forever. God shut the lions' mouths and they have not hurt me.\"",
        "With joy the king commanded his men to take Daniel from the den. Then he made a new law saying that all the people of his kingdom should fear and honor the God of Daniel. He knew that the God who delivered Daniel from the power of the lions was the true and living God."

        "\"There is not going to be any more rain in this land until I say so,\" Elijah told the king. No rain! Well, you can imagine how King Ahab felt. He knew that without rain the plants would die and there would be no food to eat. If it did not rain, the rivers and brooks and streams would dry up and there would be no water to drink. The animals needed food and water in order to live. And what would happen to the people?",
        "God knew that this message would make King Ahab very angry and he would try to hurt Elijah. But Elijah was not afraid. He knew that God would take care of him. After Elijah delivered the message to the king, God told him to go and hide by a brook called Cherith. It was near the Jordan River.",
        "When Elijah came to the brook he found that he had plenty of water to drink but there was no food. Yet God had told him that the ravens would feed him! Can you imagine that! How could birds feed a man? But Elijah was not worried because he believed God. And sure enough, every morning and night God sent the big, black birds to Elijah with bread and meat.",
        "After a while the brook dried up because there had been no rain in all the land. But God had another plan for Elijah. He sent him to a city called Zarephath. There Elijah was to go to the home of a certain widow lady. God told Elijah that the lady would give him food to eat.",
        "When Elijah arrived at her home he found her outside collecting sticks for a fire. He asked her to please get him a drink of water. As she was going to get the water Elijah also asked her for a piece of bread to eat.",
        "She stopped and told him that she didn't have any bread. All she had was a handful of flour and a tiny bit of oil. That was just enough flour and oil for one little cake. She had planned to prepare that for her son and herself. But Elijah said that if she would prepare some for him first, God would make her little bit of flour and oil last until the rain would come again. Some people might not believe that God could do such a miracle but this lady did. So she shared what she had and God did make the flour and oil last until the rain came again.",

        "Elijah told King Ahab to gather all the people and the false prophets at Mt. Carmel. There he told them that they could not serve the one true God and the false gods at the same time. He told the false prophets to prepare a sacrifice but not to put any fire under it. They had to pray to their false gods and ask for fire to come down from the sky. They did what Elijah said and prayed all morning and all afternoon. They prayed until evening, but no fire came.",
        "Then Elijah set up his sacrifice. He made an altar with twelve stones. All around the altar he dug a ditch. He put some wood and the sacrifice on top of the altar. Then twelve barrels of water were poured over all of it!",
        "When that was all done, Elijah began to pray. He looked up to Heaven and asked God to send fire on the sacrifice so the people would know who was the true God. Right then, fire came down from the sky and burned up Elijah's sacrifice and dried up all the water too! When the people saw this they believed that Elijah's God was the one true God.",
        "After that, Elijah went to the top of the mountain and prayed for rain. He told his servant to look out over the sea for any sign of rain. The servant looked but told Elijah that he didn't see anything. Elijah told him to look again. The servant looked again and again and still saw nothing. But when he looked the seventh time he told Elijah that he saw a little cloud. Elijah told his servant to run and tell King Ahab to get into his chariot and hurry home because rain was coming!

        "God told His prophet Elisha what the king planned to do. Elisha warned the king of Israel so the people in that city could be prepared. This happened over and over again. Each time the Syrian king made plans to fight in a certain place, God told Elisha. And Elisha would then warn the king of Israel.",
        "The king of Syria was so angry! He didn't know how Israel was finding out all his plans, so he called his servants together. He asked which of them was telling all his secret plans. He wanted to know who was on Israel's side.",
        "One of his servants told him that it wasn't any of them. He told the king it was Elisha who was telling the secret plans to the king of Israel.",
        "Since it was Elisha who was ruining the king of Syria's plans, the King decided to capture God's prophet. He sent some spies to check and see where Elisha was staying. When they returned they told the king that Elisha was in the city of Dothan. The king then sent a great big army after just one man, Elisha. That night the Syrian horses and chariots and soldiers circled clear around the city so Elisha couldn't get away.",
        "Elisha's servant got up very early the next morning and went outside. He saw at once that soldiers were on every side of the city. He was afraid and cried, \"Master, what shall we do?\"",
        "Elisha prayed that God would open the eyes of his servant. Suddenly the servant saw that the mountains were full of horses and chariots of fire. God had sent these to protect Elisha. The servant was not afraid anymore.",
        "When the Syrian army came into the city of Dothan, Elisha asked God to make them blind. And God did it! Then Elisha told the Syrian soldiers to follow him. They didn't know who he was so they went with Elisha. He led them into Samaria.",
        "When they reached Samaria, Elisha asked God to let the soldiers see again. The Lord opened their eyes and they saw that they were surrounded by their enemy! The king of Israel was excited. He asked Elisha, \"Shall I kill them? Shall I kill them?\"",
        "\"No!\" Elisha told him, \"You must treat them well. Feed them and give them water to drink. Then let them go home to their master.\" The army of Syria had tried to kill Elisha but he treated them kindly! Then he sent them away and they went home to their king. The Syrians never tried to go into the land of Israel or harm Elisha again."

        "I had heard a lot about Jesus and His wonderful power. I had heard about the miracles He did and the stories He told. I wanted to see Him. One day Jesus was going to be coming through my town of Jericho. I went out early so I could get a good place near the front of the crowd. I knew that I would not be able to see over all the people so I needed to arrive before they did. But I wasn't early enough. A huge crowd of people had gathered there already! They must have been excited to see Jesus, and wanted to be near the front of the crowd too. As I looked around me I noticed a large sycamore tree. It was a little way up the road. I ran to the tree and climbed up onto a branch. I thought it was a pretty clever thing to do because I had a good view of the road from there. The tree had lots of leaves so I was sure no one would see me. But I was wrong!",
        "Before long I heard some people in the crowd saying that Jesus was coming. I peeked through the leaves and, sure enough, there He was.",

        "People all around started to complain. They couldn't believe that Jesus would come to my house. They did not like me because I was not an honest person.",
        "I didn't listen to the people. I just stood there next to Jesus and told Him that I had done many wrong things. I had taken money from people, but now I was sorry. I told Jesus I would pay back all that money. In fact, I would even pay four times the amount that I had taken. That meant if I had taken one dollar from someone I would give back four dollars!",
        "Do you know what Jesus did then? He forgave me! And as He talked to me, such a happy feeling came into my heart. I felt so good and clean inside. I still do. I'm very glad that Jesus loves me and has the power to forgive sin."

I was curious to see what the men were going to do with him, so I followed behind them. When they reached the roof they carefully laid the sick man to one side.

I want you to know that the Son of God has power to forgive sins.\" Then Jesus turned to the man who was sick with palsy. He said to him, \"Stand up, pick up your bed, and go to your own house.\"",

When they arrived they saw me sitting quietly at Jesus' feet. I was listening to all He had to say. I was healed! The people couldn't understand what had happened, so they were afraid. They told Jesus to go away.",
        "I didn't want Jesus to go. He had given me a peace inside that was wonderful. I told Jesus to please take me with Him. But Jesus said to me, \"Go back to your own house. Show your people what great things I have done for you.\" And then He went away.",
        "I went home at once and told everyone what Jesus had done for me. The people listened. They could see that I was well again. The devil could no longer make me do strange things. After this the people were anxious to meet Jesus. And they were very glad when Jesus came to our town of Gadara again.",

Do you think your mother and brothers and I should bow down to you?\" But even though he didn't understand Joseph's dream, Jacob kept thinking about it. He knew there must be a reason that God had sent the dreams.",

Oh, how they must have hated him to sell their very own brother as a slave! He wondered what his father Jacob was feeling. He had loved Joseph as a favorite son.

        "Jeff opened the envelope his dad had just handed him as they walked out of the post office. \"Look what my Sunday school teacher mailed to me. It looks just like a traffic light,\" Jeff said. He held up a small, black piece of paper that had three circles glued onto it—green, yellow, and red.",
        "\"It sure does,\" said Mr. Andersen. \"With those three colors it has to be a traffic light.\" Jeff took another piece of paper out of the envelope and read it. Then he said to his dad, \"We're right! This note that came with it says, 'Don't miss next Sunday. We'll learn how a traffic light can remind us of the different ways God answers our prayers.' I wonder what Teacher Dave means by that, Dad? How can traffic lights be like answers to prayers?\"",
        "Just then they came to the corner where they stopped and waited for the light to change before they crossed the street. Mr. Andersen said, \"Jeff, this red light tells us that it is not safe to cross the street right now. That is sort of like God's saying no when we ask for something that He knows is not good for us.",
        "\"Look at the light that just changed to yellow for the cars going the other way. That is a warning to them that they had better get ready to stop because their light is going to change to red. They are going to have to wait for a little bit before it will be safe for them to go again. Sometimes when we pray, God tells us that we will have to wait. And it is a good thing for us if we do wait. We have to remember that God knows when it is the best time for us.",
        "\"Now look at our light. It just turned green,\" said Mr. Andersen. He and Jeff started to walk across the street as he said, \"A green light means we can go. When we pray and God answers yes, we can be sure that we have His blessing. We can know that it is a good thing and the right time for that answer.\"",
        "\"It feels good when we know that God will give the right answer for each of our prayers,\" said Jeff. \"This will be a fun lesson in Sunday school. And now that we have talked about it, I'll be able to answer a lot of the teacher's questions.",
        "\"You know, Dad,\" Jeff added quietly, \"sometimes I have thought that God didn't hear some of my prayers. Now I know that He was just saying no or wait.\" \"That's right,\" said Mr. Andersen. \"God loves and cares for us. He wants to protect us. It's just like that traffic light. We can be safe as long as we pay attention to the signals.\""

I know God can't always say yes, she thought. But He knows when something we pray for is right for us and He lets it happen. Andy had said that God always answers our prayers in the way that is best for us.",

Beth had never been in a wedding before and she wanted to do her very best. She looked down at the beautiful, pink dress she was wearing. There were so many ruffles and lots of pretty white lace. She thought this must be the most beautiful dress at the wedding—except Aunt Sue's dress, of course! She looked behind her at Aunt Sue. She looked so pretty in her long, lacy, white wedding dress! Beth was so excited!",

It was her turn. \"Go!\" the lady whispered, and Beth stepped out, her heart beating fast.

Seth heard him asking God to be with them and guide them through the storm. He could feel his fears leave as he listened to the quiet words. He felt such a peace down in his heart.",
        "Inside the small cabin they sat quietly for a while. Through the windows they watched the storm. Then Seth's grandfather suddenly exclaimed, \"We're going to make it!\"",

The dark clouds parted, and a brilliant stream of light from the moon fell across the troubled sea. Then one by one the stars came out from their hiding places. And slowly the sea became calmer.",
        "\"Look, Grandpa!\" Seth cried out excitedly. \"Isn't that the North Star?\" \"It sure is,” his grandfather replied. \"We are no longer lost. We can now use the stars in the heavens to guide us safely home!",
        "\"You know, Seth,\" he continued, \"after a storm like that we should be ever so grateful for God's wonderful creation. Some people don't realize that God placed those stars very carefully in space. He knew that each part of His universe would play a special part in the times and seasons of each year. We should be very thankful for the sun and the moon. And right now, you and I should be especially thankful for those stars! Because of them we can know exactly which way to travel. Let's just get this boat headed toward home.\"",
        "Seth followed his grandfather back into the cabin. He looked up at the sky through the cabin window. \"Thank You, God,\" he prayed, \"for making all the stars. Thank You for putting them in the sky to guide us.\" Then he turned and said, \"Grandpa, I can hardly wait to get home. I'm going to tell all my friends about this miracle in the storm.\""

Allow your child to trace around it onto a piece of yellow felt, and then cut out the star he has drawn.

He had even missed being able to run to the corner store to spend his allowance. But now Troy didn't think he would ever be bored again. There was just too much to explore and enjoy here in the country!",
        "It was early morning and Troy was sitting on the front steps when he heard Simba barking. He laughed as the golden-colored spaniel stumbled and bumped her nose while running to meet him. He had been thrilled when his dad brought this new puppy home. They hadn't been able to have any pets in their apartment in the city.",
        "\"C'mon, girl!\" Troy said, getting up off the porch steps. \"Let's go check out the garden. Dad says my pumpkins are almost ready to pick.\" Troy and Simba raced across the green lawn, through the barnyard, and down the hill to the spot Dad had given him for his very own garden. It seemed like only yesterday he had planted those little seeds. Now there must be close to thirty pumpkins! Their round, orange shapes were scattered in the tangle of thick vines.",
        "\"They look really good, Simba,\" he said. \"I think people will buy all of the ones I put out at our roadside stand. Thanksgiving is almost here, and they can't make a pumpkin pie without a pumpkin!\"",
        "Then Troy saw his dad coming out of the barn. He had just finished milking the cows. Troy and Simba ran back up the hill to meet him. \"Hey, Dad, will you be able to go down to the creek with me today?\" he asked. \"You said we should go before all the trout were gone.\"",
        "His dad laughed. \"I think today would be just fine. We'll go after lunch. Do you think you'll have your chores finished by then?\" he asked. \"Sure I will. Come on Simba, let's get busy,\" Troy called over his shoulder as he ran toward the house. Even with chores to do, he still liked the country.",

It was fun helping to plant our garden and watching it grow. The fishing is great! And being able to have a puppy of my very own is super,\" Troy said as he knelt down to give Simba a hug. \"I'm so thankful God made such a beautiful world.\""

        "\"You already know, Janie, that you should always tell the truth. And you know that you should never say bad things about another person, even if they are true. But did you know that it isn't even good for you to think about things that are false? And you should never think bad things about someone else. And if you ever feel scared, you can start singing a good song, like 'Jesus Loves Me.' Or you can just start thanking Jesus for all the things He has done for you. If we will think about the good things, we will have perfect peace. That is a promise from God!\"",
        "\"Well, I feel happy right now,\" laughed Janie. \"I am thankful God gave me a mind. And Charlie will believe that I do have a brain when I thank him!\" \"What do you mean?\" asked her mother. \"Why are you going to thank Charlie?\"",

It took only ten minutes to walk there from home. Soon, Ruthie, Brian, and Stevie arrived at the zoo. They each ran to watch a favorite animal. Stevie liked the otter best. Ruthie enjoyed watching the tiny groundhogs going in and out of their network of tunnels. They could disappear so fast and then suddenly appear at the other side of their small mound.",
        "\"Look over here!\" exclaimed Brian. He was standing by Bill's cage. Bill was Brian's favorite animal, an ornery old chimpanzee who was always grumpy. The three children watched as the zookeeper fed the old animal and the other chimp who shared the cage. He put the food on the floor of the big cage. Bill acted like he was afraid that the other chimp would get part of the food. Bill grabbed as much as he could as fast as he could. He stuffed an apple into his mouth, jammed two bananas under one arm and a big bunch of carrots under the other. Then he ran over to the food by the other chimp and grabbed a loaf of bread with one hand. Just as he was about to pick up a bunch of grapes with the other, he noticed a piece of lettuce the other chimp was holding. The greedy animal snatched the lettuce, slapping it on the top of his head. Then he picked up the grapes and ran to the corner of his cage, starting to eat even while he ran.",
        "How the children laughed! \"Look at him,\" said Ruthie. \"He is so selfish he can't even enjoy eating, his mouth is so full. He just had to have it all, even the food that belonged to the other chimp in there!\"",
        "Just then Mom came over to where the children were. They pointed to old Bill sitting alone in the corner, looking around to see if there was any more food he could grab. \"Look how unhappy Bill is,\" said Ruthie. \"That's a good example of coveting. He wants things only for himself.\" \"That's right,” said Mom. \"And if you ever think that in order to be happy you must have something that isn't yours, just remember old Bill. Jesus teaches us that we must be content with what we have. Let's learn a lesson from this greedy old chimp!\""

        "\"What is that heart doing there?\" Tara wondered aloud, looking at it curiously. Mrs. Evans smiled at her. \"Touch it,\" she said. Tara gave a questioning look, but when her teacher nodded she reached out and touched the heart. To her amazement it fell apart!",
        "\"It broke!\" Tara turned to her teacher. \"Oh, Mrs. Evans, I'm sorry!\" \"No, no, don't worry Tara.\" Mrs. Evans hugged the girl. \"It's supposed to break.\" \"But, why?\" Julie wanted to know.",
        "\"Because it represents God's heart,\" Mrs. Evans said as she put the pieces together again. \"You see, God loved Adam and Eve with all His heart. He made Adam in His own image. Then, when they sinned and went against the things God had taught them, it broke His heart.\" \"That's so sad,\" Tara sighed.",
        "\"Yes, it was sad for them. But our lives can have a happy ending,\" Mrs. Evans told the girls as she set the rebuilt heart back into the garden. \"It hurts Jesus when we sin. But, if we pray to Him and tell Him we're sorry for our sins, just as Tara told me she was sorry for breaking the heart, it makes Jesus happy. And our hearts are happy too!\""

Evening was a time for sitting around the campfire, roasting hot dogs, and watching for shooting stars. Aunt Kathy would bring out her guitar, and the family would sing hymns and folk songs until time for bed. Then they'd crawl into their cozy sleeping bags and fall asleep listening to the sounds of owls hooting and crickets chirping.",
        "One day Monica was helping her mother and Aunt Kathy set out food on the picnic table. As she reached for a stack of paper plates, she accidentally hit the edge of the table and ran a splinter into her finger. She let out a piercing scream and grabbed her finger tightly. Aunt Kathy quickly wrapped a damp towel around Monica's hand and they sat down on a nearby stump.",
        "\"Oh, Aunt Kathy, my finger hurts. Hurry and get this splinter out. Please,\" cried Monica. Aunt Kathy soon had the splinter out. As she wrapped Monica's hurt finger she said, \"This bandage will help to stop the bleeding and to keep the wound clean.\"",
        "\"Thank you for helping,\" said Monica. \"That splinter really hurt.\" Later that night, as they were sitting around the campfire, Monica said, \"My finger is feeling better now, Aunt Kathy.\" \"I'm so glad,\" replied Aunt Kathy. \"You know, that started me thinking about when Jesus died. His hands were nailed to the cross. That little splinter hurt you very much and your finger bled a little bit. But just think of how Jesus must have hurt and bled. He was hurt so badly He died.",
        "\"You didn't mean to hurt your finger, Monica, but you couldn't help it,\" Aunt Kathy continued. \"Jesus could have stopped Himself from being hurt. But Jesus loved us so much He died for us. There is a verse in the Bible that says, 'The blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.' That is the reason God sent Jesus to this world. Jesus was the only One who was good enough to die for our sins.\"",

Others cut down palm branches from nearby trees and waved them in the air as Jesus rode by on a donkey.",
        "Two of Jesus' disciples had borrowed the donkey from a man who lived in a small village. They had told the man that the Lord needed it, so he let them use it. He was happy to do this for Jesus. The disciples put their coats on the donkey's back so Jesus would have a nice place to sit. They wanted to do whatever they could for Jesus.",

The people who loved Jesus were praising Him and saying, \"Blessed is the King! Peace on earth.\" They wanted Jesus to be their King.",
        "Some of the Pharisees complained to Jesus. They told Jesus to tell His friends to stop saying these things. The Pharisees were important people in Jerusalem and they thought Jesus should do whatever they said. But Jesus knew that this was a very important time.

But why should the stones have to praise Jesus when we can praise Him? Aren't you glad that Jesus made us so we could love Him and praise Him in everything we say? And just like those people so many years ago, we can say, \"Jesus, we love You! Jesus, we praise You! Hosanna!\""

With that thought in mind, we begin a five-part series of lessons on God's promises.\nTo reinforce the basic principle to be taught in this set of lessons, help your child design and create a \"Promise Banner.\" Cut a banner shape from felt, and draw out a simple, bold design featuring the words, \"God Keeps His Promises.\" Using fabric scraps, bits of trim, and glue, fill in the letters and decorate the banner.\nPut up the banner where it can be noticed and commented on often throughout the month."

He was amazed when God spoke to him from the bush, \"Go to Pharaoh and tell him to let My people go. I will be with you.\" Pharaoh was the most important man in the whole country. Why should he listen to Moses? But Moses did as God said. What would you have done?",

Only when they had crossed the river could they conquer the walled city of Jericho. God reminded Joshua that He had been with Moses, and He said, \"I will be with you also.\" The waters looked deep and wide. But Joshua did as God said. What would you have done?",
        "God told a man named Gideon to lead the army of Israel into battle with just 300 men. They were to fight against a great army of 135,000! God said, \"Go and save Israel. I will be with you.\" Why would God want them to fight with so few men in their army? Gideon did not understand, but he did as God said. What would you have done?",
        "Do you know why Moses, Joshua, and Gideon obeyed God? They obeyed because God made a promise to each of them. He said, \"I will be with you.\" They had faith in God's words. They knew God would keep His promise. God was with Moses, and he led the people out of Egypt. God was with Joshua, and the waters of Jordan parted. God was with Gideon, and his few men won the battle against the large army.",

This lesson is about how God was with several notable characters of the Bible, and your child will learn that God will be with him also.\nTo illustrate that God is with us, even though we can't see Him, write your child an invisible message on a card. Use a clean pin or toothpick to write your message with lemon or grapefruit juice. Dip the pin in the juice after every three or four letters. Use matte (not shiny) paper so the juice soaks in and disappears.\nTo make the juice visible, help your child press the paper with a warm iron or move it around close to an electric light bulb. Heat makes the message appear. Point out that the words were there, even when your child couldn't see them, and in the same way, God is with us even when we can't see Him with our physical eyes."

You wouldn't call your father \"my old man,\" but some other children might. We feel unhappy when someone speaks against our parents or criticizes them. Why? Because it isn't respectful, it is not honoring our parents.",

Shouldn't you do as he said?\" Naaman stopped. He thought about what his servant said. Then he made up his mind. He would do it! He would obey the strange words of Elisha. He would wash seven times in the muddy water of the Jordan River.",

You will need a roll of white paper (such as is used to cover tables) or end rolls of newsprint which is often available from local newspaper offices.\nCut a length of paper your child's height plus a few inches. Have him lie on the paper. Trace around him to make an outline of his body. Your child can then color in the hair, features, and clothing to match his own.

At the dinner table this evening, Mama had told Daddy that Grandma wanted Julie to spend the summer vacation with her and Grandpa. Julie had never been away from home for that long before, but she loved going to Grandma's. Mama had asked Daddy what he thought. \"What does Julie want to do?\" he asked. They told her to think about it.",
        "Now she couldn't sleep. She thought about the trip her mother and father were planning to take. It would be fun to go with them, she thought. But if I stay with Grandma I'll get to go to the camp meeting with her and to the youth camp afterward. She always helps at the youth camp. Grandma says I would have lots of fun.",
        "Julie loved being with Grandma and Grandpa. They told her Bible stories, and showed her where to find those stories in her own Bible. They had even given her the Bible she had just read out of tonight. It was Grandma and Grandpa who had prayed with her when she had asked Jesus to come into her heart. She still remembered that night and how happy she had been. She loved Jesus so much! She wished she lived near Grandma and Grandpa so she could always go to church and Sunday school.",
        "If she went to her grandparents for the summer she could go to church for that long at least. Grandma had asked Mama and Daddy to stop by on their trip and enjoy part of the camp meeting. I wish they would, she thought. I want them to ask Jesus into their hearts too.",
        "\"This is sort of like Ruth in the Bible story,\" Julie whispered to herself. \"She had to decide whether to go with Naomi or stay with her family.\" Closing her eyes, Julie continued to think about that Bible story. Ruth's mother-in-law, Naomi, had lived many years in the land of Moab. That was where Ruth's family lived. When Naomi was planning to return to her homeland, Ruth had to decide whether to go with her or not. If she went with Naomi she would be going a long way to another country to live. It might be many years before she saw her family again. Maybe she would never see them again! But Ruth made the decision to go with Naomi because she loved her and she loved Naomi's God. I'd like to be like Ruth . . .",
        "\"Mama! Daddy!\" Julie said as she came to the breakfast table the next morning. \"I've decided what I'm going to do during my vacation. I'm going to go to Grandma and Grandpa's. Do you want to know why?\""

He was to have a very special diet and he was never to have his hair cut. When the child grew up, God would work through him to free the Children of Israel. When the baby was born, his parents named him Samson.",
        "As Samson grew older, God's Spirit made him very strong. With his bare hands he killed a lion, and another time he destroyed a thousand enemies with the jawbone of a donkey. But one day Samson made a very bad mistake. He told the secret of his great strength to one of the Philistine women. Her name was Delilah. He let her know that if his hair was cut he would lose his strength.",
        "Delilah told Samson's secret to the Philistines, and while Samson was asleep she had them cut off his hair. What a terrible thing to do! Because Samson didn't do the right thing, God's Spirit left him. Samson's strength was gone. The Philistines put him into prison, and put his eyes out. How awful! Don't you think Samson was sorry he had told his secret?",
        "Time went by. One day the Philistines had a great feast. They called for Samson because they wanted to make fun of him. But God was ready to use Samson again. They brought Samson into the great hall where the feast was going on. Samson asked to be led to the two huge pillars which held up the building. He prayed to God for strength to stop the wicked men and women who were very mean to the Children of Israel. Then, with all his might, he pushed over the pillars. With a thunderous crash, the building fell, destroying all the Philistines.",

Why do you think Esther was chosen by the king?\"",

God was going to send so much rain that the whole earth would be covered with water. He was going to do that because all the people in the world were being very bad—all the people except Noah and his family. Noah loved God. The other people didn't love God.",

It rained until all the bushes and trees and houses and mountains and people were covered with water. Noah and all that were in the boat with him were dry. Noah trusted God and knew He would keep them safe.",
        "Finally the rain stopped, but for a long time the water stayed on the earth. Perhaps Noah looked out the window many times and wondered when they would be able to leave the boat. It was many more days before the land was dry again. When it was time for Noah and his family to leave the boat, they were so happy. Noah built an altar so they could pray and thank God for keeping them safe.",

All the families of the earth will be blessed because of you.\" Abraham obeyed God. He called his whole family together. They helped him gather his sheep and his cattle. They helped him pack his tents and everything else that he owned. Then they all started on a long journey.",
        "At last they came to the land of Canaan. It was a beautiful land. There were wonderful fields where the sheep and cattle could eat. God spoke to Abraham again. He said He would give all that land to Abraham, and to his children, and to their children.",
        "Abraham and his wife had no children. But God now promised them that they would have a son. God told them to name their son Isaac. God also told Abraham that he would have many, many grandchildren and great-grandchildren. And there would be so many more that they could not even be counted.",
        "Now, Abraham loved God more than ever before. He built an altar and made an offering to God. He was thankful that God trusted him to be part of His wonderful plan. All the promises that God gave to Abraham came true! The special family that God promised to him, later became known as the Jewish nation. And on the very first Christmas night, near where Abraham had once lived, Jesus was born into that family.",
        "God has a plan for each of us too. But, like Abraham, we must obey God. If we do this, God will know that we love and trust Him. I wonder what special plan God has for you?"

You would have to take notes and then report back to the person who sent you. That person would expect you to tell carefully about everything that you had seen and heard. Do you think you would have a hard time remembering everything?",

        "Many years ago, God gave special instructions to Moses, the leader of the Children of Israel. Moses was to choose twelve spies to go into the land of Canaan and look all around. Their job would be to find out all about the country. Was it a good land or bad? How large were the cities? How many people lived in the land? The spies were also told to bring back some of the fruit that was grown in Canaan. They were to show this fruit to Moses and the people.",
        "Among the twelve spies chosen by Moses, were Joshua and Caleb. Both were men who loved and trusted God. They believed God and obeyed Him.",
        "For forty days the spies searched through the land of Canaan. They must have been excited by what they found. The land was beautiful. It had flowing rivers and lots of trees and good fruit. When it was time to leave, the men cut down one cluster of grapes to take back to Moses. That cluster was so big that it took two strong men to carry it!",
        "The twelve spies told Moses that everything was exactly like God had said it would be. But ten of the spies were afraid. When they looked at the land they saw the high-walled cities and the people of the land who looked like giants. Those ten spies said, \"We cannot take this land! We are not able to do it.\" They forgot that God had promised to help them. They forgot that God had said the land would be theirs.",
        "Joshua and Caleb didn't forget. They trusted God and knew He would give them the land. Caleb told Moses and the people, \"We can take this land!

Now it was time for them to go and live in the land. Jericho was the first city that the people came to in the land of Canaan. It had to be captured! Jericho was a strong city that was surrounded by high walls. How was Joshua going to capture that city? He was glad he didn't have to figure it out all by himself. He trusted God to help him. God gave Joshua a plan. The plan sounded very strange. It wasn't the kind of plan you or I would have thought of.",

The only sound that would be heard each day, was the sound of seven trumpets. The trumpets would be blown by seven priests. On the seventh day they were to march around the city seven times. And on the seventh time everyone was to shout when they heard the sound of the trumpets.",

And the people of Israel wanted to do what Joshua told them. They didn't understand, but they knew that if God told them to do something, He would help them to do it.",

The people had never seen Jesus do any miracles yet. They had never heard Him preach. How could He, just a carpenter's son, be their Savior? They didn't know that He was really God's Son.",

During class time your child will learn that the universe was created to declare the glory of God and to reveal His power.\nAs you discuss with your child the different things that make up our universe—the sky, the sun, the stars, the moon—suggest to him that he might like to make a sun catcher to remind him of the things God has made for our enjoyment. Begin by dipping a length of craft cord into white craft glue. On a piece of waxed paper or plastic wrap, shape the drenched cord into a simple shape representative of something in the universe, such as a star, and let it dry. Peel the shape from the paper and coat the backside of the shape with glue. Lay the shape on a piece of brightly colored tissue paper, and allow it to dry. Cut away excess paper from the shape and glue a thread loop hanger to the shape. Display your child's creation in a sunny window."

        "A long time ago there was no dry land at all. There was water everywhere! God knew that part of His creation would need dry land so He said, \"Let the dry land appear.\" And it did!",
        "God wanted the land to be beautiful. He covered parts of it with green grass so we could have parks, pastures, and yards. Isn't it fun to play in the grass and feel it tickle your toes? God made all the grains of sand. There is sand in the desert where the cactus plants grow. God put some of it by the ocean so we could build sand castles at the beach.",
        "He made different kinds of flowers—red roses, white daisies, yellow daffodils, and so many more. And they smell so sweet! God made many kinds of trees. There are forests of trees that are used to build houses. There are orchards of trees that grow fruit such as apples, oranges, and pears. He made nut trees so we could enjoy walnuts, pecans, and almonds.",
        "He made vegetables—more kinds than we can name. Bright orange carrots, juicy red tomatoes, big brown potatoes, and leafy green lettuce are just a few of the things God put on the earth for us to eat. Can you think of some others? What are your favorites? Flowers, trees, and vegetables all grew on the land that God had made.",
        "The world was finally ready for living creatures. First God created the things that would live in the water—big sharks for the ocean and little trout for the lakes. He made the tiny goldfish that swim in fish bowls, and the huge whales that swim in the ocean.",
        "Then God made the birds that fly in the air—chirping sparrows, noisy crows, and ducks that quack. Blue birds and black birds, brown birds and white birds were created for us to enjoy. Finally God made the animals that live on the land. He made big tigers that roar, elephants that wave their trunks, and tiny insects that crawl.",
        "He made some animals that are fun to have as pets, like cuddly kittens that meow and frisky puppies that wiggle and play with you. Some animals are not meant to live with us. The big bears and graceful deer live in the woods. The alligators belong in the warm rivers. We can see many of these animals when we visit the zoo.",
        "God saw that everything he made was good, and that made Him happy. God made these for us to enjoy too, because He loves us."

It looked a little bit like a horse. Do you think Adam named that one a zebra or a skunk?",

        "Goliath was angry when he saw David coming! Why, Goliath was over nine feet tall and David was so much smaller! How Goliath raged! David wasn't afraid when he heard Goliath. He called out, \"I come to you in the name of the Lord.\" David told Goliath that God would win the battle. Then everyone would know how great the God of Israel was.",
        "David put a stone in his sling. He ran toward the giant, swinging the sling around and around. Suddenly, David let the stone fly. THUD! The stone hit the giant right in the head. Down he went, flat on his face! God helped David defeat the giant. David was right! His God was greater than a giant. His God was stronger than a giant. He didn't have to be afraid.",
        "God loves and helps all of us too. God's people never have to be afraid."

The emphasis for this lesson is that God will be with those who trust in Him.\nThe Philistine champion was reported to be over nine feet tall. To illustrate to your child how high this is, measure that distance and have him stand beside it.\nA simple shepherd's pouch can be made by cutting a circle from a brown paper bag approximately 7\" in diameter. Punch small holes around the circle, about 1/2\" from the edge. Crumple the circle between your hands to make it resemble leather. Thread a cord through the holes and pull up to form a pouch. Let your child search for five smooth stones to put into the pouch."

Jonathan would be his friend. How excited David must have been! Jonathan was happy too. He thought David was the bravest person he knew. He also knew that David loved God. Jonathan loved God too.",
        "At last the great day came. David arrived at the palace. The two young men became good friends. To show David how much he liked him, Jonathan gave David some of his very own clothes to wear. Now David was dressed just like a prince! Then Jonathan gave David his own special sword and bow. He was not jealous of David, even though he knew that some day David would be king instead of him.",
        "David was only a poor shepherd and he had nothing to give to Jonathan in return, except his friendship. He promised always to be a good friend to Jonathan. One day David was in trouble. King Saul was angry because everyone cared for David more than they cared for their own King! The people liked David because he had been brave and killed Goliath. King Saul was so jealous that he decided to kill David!",
        "David asked Jonathan what he should do. Jonathan told David he must run away and hide so that King Saul could not find him. It was a very sad time for the two friends. They knew they might never see each other again.",
        "Before David left they made a promise to each other. David promised he always would be kind to Jonathan and his family. They agreed that the friendship between their families would last forever. Jonathan and David said goodbye to each other and David went away. David never did see his friend Jonathan again, but he always remembered what a good friend he had been. David knew Jonathan had helped to save his life. He had warned David and had helped him get away from Saul, Jonathan's own father.",
        "Later, when David did become king, he welcomed Jonathan's crippled son into his home and took care of him. In this way, David kept the promise he had made to Jonathan those many years before."

        "\"Even before that happened, David knew that someday he would be king,\" Jessica went on. \"God's prophet, Samuel, had come to his father's house one day. God told Samuel to choose David from all his brothers, and anoint him to be the next king of Israel.\" \"How come he didn't just make him king right then?\" David asked.",
        "Jessica looked a little puzzled. “I'm not sure . . . Mom, what do you think?” \"Well, I believe it was because God knew the best time for David to become king. Perhaps there were more lessons David needed to learn about trusting God and looking to Him for help. David had to wait and be patient for a while.\" Jessica nodded. “Anyway, David did wait, and one day God's promise to him came true.\"",

        "Jennifer stared down at the blank piece of paper in front of her. Should she do it? What if everyone in the class made fun of her?",
        "Mrs. Morrow had told them to write about, \"What I Am Thankful For,\" and then draw a picture of what they had written about. The first thought that had popped into Jennifer's mind was that she was thankful for Jesus. She was! Jesus had done so much for her and she really loved Him.",
        "All of her friends had decided to write about their mommies, or their homes, or their pets. It might be embarrassing to write about Jesus. If the teacher was the only one to read it, that wouldn't be so bad. But Mrs. Morrow had said that all the papers were going to be put up on a Thanksgiving bulletin board. That meant all the kids in the class would see what she had written!",
        "Let's see. What else could she write about? Maybe about her mom and dad like some of the others were doing? She was thankful for them, but . . . after all, Jesus was the One who had given her a good mom and dad. Should she write about her pet kitten, Somecat? She was thankful her prayer had been answered and she had received a kitty for her birthday last June. Or maybe she should write about food—all her favorites like strawberries and peaches and corn on the cob. Jesus made all these delicious things to enjoy.",
        "But somehow Jennifer couldn't get started writing. Nothing seemed to be just right. She kept thinking, But it's Jesus who gave me all the good things I'm thankful for. I really should write about Him.",
        "Maybe if she tried drawing a picture first that would help. She tried drawing her mom and dad, but they looked funny. The kitten she worked on next looked more like a dog. She erased her strawberries and peaches too. By that time her paper was all smudgy. She threw it away and reached for her notebook to get another sheet.",
        "Then her eyes fell on her lesson leaflet for next Sunday. Just this morning, she had read the story about the woman who met Jesus at the well. That woman hadn't been afraid to tell others about Jesus! She had run right into the city and told everyone she met about Him. She was a witness for Christ because she was so thankful.",
        "All of a sudden Jennifer knew what she was going to do. This was her chance to be a witness! She could tell all the kids in her class about Jesus. Her paper might be a little different from all the others, but it was one way she could say thank you for all the blessings Jesus had given her."

        "Last week, word came that Jesus was traveling our way. You can imagine the excitement, for we had all heard so much about this Man. Why, just a short time ago the Widow Esther's son heard Him speak, and with his own eyes saw a lame man healed! So when we heard that Jesus was coming, nearly everyone wanted to go hear Him.",
        "Even my father left his leather shop, and early one morning we started out. It was late in the afternoon when we found Him, and already a great many people were there. We had to work our way through the crowd in order to get close enough to hear. James, I wish you could have heard Him. He spoke as One who knew everything! When He began to teach, the crowd was silent. Everyone listened.",
        "Time went by so quickly that it still seems hard for me to believe. He rested for a while in the hours of darkness, but early in the morning He began teaching again. We were there for three days! We just could not leave. Every thought of home and what was going on in our city just disappeared. We thought of nothing but Him.",
        "We had not gone prepared to stay so long, and there was little food among us. On the third day someone brought Jesus seven loaves and a few fishes, but of course that was not enough to feed so many. Everyone was hungry.",
        "It was then I saw the miracle. Jesus bowed His head, and He prayed aloud to His Father in Heaven, thanking Him for this food. Then His disciples passed the loaves and fishes among the people nearby, and went back to Jesus. More was given out. In the end, the entire group was fed. And afterward seven baskets of pieces were gathered together! Truly, this could only have been done by the power of God.",
        "Looking back, I think that what remains most clearly in my mind is Jesus bowing His head over that food. He had power, James, power to make that little bit of food feed so many. Yet He prayed and thanked His heavenly Father for it! I will never again eat a meal without following His example.",

        "Andy thought for a minute. \"Well, he's such a neat guy, Dad. He has great stories to tell, and his stories always make me feel happy.\" Andy's dad raised his eyebrows. \"Oh? Now it seems to me that many of Al's stories have to do with some very hard times. There's the one about when his boat capsized and he nearly drowned. There's the story about how his army buddies made fun of him because he wouldn't do all the wrong things they did. Then he tells about the time his wife died and he had to raise three little children by himself. Are those happy stories?\"",
        "\"No . . .\" Andy answered, “not exactly. I guess they make me feel happy because Uncle Al's stories always have a happy ending.\" His father smiled. \"I think you're right, Andy. Uncle Al found out that even though there are hard places in life, there is victory when you have your trust in God.\"",

        "\"Paul?\" Andy looked puzzled. \"But he doesn't look anything like the picture of Paul in our Bible storybook. And he never got put in jail or went on any big missionary trips, or anything like that.\" \"Oh, I don't mean how he looks,\" his dad replied. \"And I don't mean the actual things that happened to him during his life. I mean his spirit, the way he reacted to the things that happened to him. Remember how Paul wrote to Timothy when he looked back at his life? In spite of all the hard places he had gone through, he was thankful to God for a life of victory.\"",
        "\"That sure does sound like Uncle Al,\" Andy agreed. \"You know, Dad, Uncle Al is pretty old. And now he's sick too, and he looks kind of weak. Someday, before too long, he'll probably go up to Heaven. That makes me feel a little sad because I will really miss him. But I just had a happy thought. Won't the Apostle Paul and Uncle Al have a good time getting to know each other up in Heaven?\""
